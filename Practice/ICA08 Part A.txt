ICA08 Part A
```

### Testing Part A

#### 1. **Visual Verification**
- Compile and flash the program
- Observe the LED:
  - Should gradually increase in brightness
  - Then gradually decrease in brightness
  - Cycle repeats approximately every 2 seconds (1s up, 1s down)

#### 2. **Oscilloscope Verification**
- **Setup:**
  - Connect oscilloscope probe to PA4
  - GND clip to board GND
  - Timebase: 500µs/div
  - Voltage: 2V/div

- **Expected Waveform:**
```
       ___     ___     ___
  3.3V|   |   |   |   |   |
      |   |___|   |___|   |___
  0V  |
      |------ 1ms ------|
      
      Frequency: 1 kHz (period = 1ms)
      Duty cycle: Changes from ~5% to ~95%
```

- **Measurements:**
  - Period: 1.0ms ± 0.01ms
  - Frequency: 1.0 kHz
  - Duty cycle: Continuously varying
  - High voltage: ~3.3V
  - Low voltage: ~0V

#### 3. **Serial Monitor Check**
- Open PuTTY or serial terminal at 115200 baud
- You should see:
```

## Part B: Budget DAC

### Hardware Setup

**Build RC Low-Pass Filter Circuit:**
```
PA7 (TIM14_CH1) ────[10kΩ R1]────┬──── TP3 (DMM + probe)
                                 │
                              [100nF C1]
                                 │
                                GND

Test Points:
  TP1 = PA7 (before resistor) - PWM signal
  TP2 = Junction of R1 and C1 - Filtering in progress
  TP3 = After C1 (to GND) - Filtered DC output
